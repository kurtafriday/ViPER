<li>When running the BK Precision 1823A Data Logging.vi example, note that the first few values may not read/write correctly due to the way the counter behaves when setting/changing mode
prior to making a measurement reading.</li> <li>Additionally, the 1823A does not have any commands to query IDN, errors, do self test, or do a reset-  the error query included is for for catching only time out errors only.</li>
<li>The RS-232 settings are not adjustable and it's fixed at baudrate: 9600, parity: none, data bits: 8, stop bits: 1.</li>
