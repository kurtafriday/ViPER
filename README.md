# ViPER

ViPER is an Object Oriented design Framework that supports dependency injection and recursive object creation.
Systems are assembled at runtime from a collection of pre-built components defined by an Object Definition Document.

How to get started: 

Clone the repository and then copy the folder ViPER\Src\ProjectTemplates to your LabVIEW202X folder. Note this branch is built in LabVIEW 2022.
Open LabVIEW and then select File -> Create Project... and then select the Medulla ViPER Component from the list of project templates.

Documentation in progress.

I've presented this framework at several GLA Conferences, for an overview and guidance please view.
